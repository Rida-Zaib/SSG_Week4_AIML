# Task 4.1 — RAG Application

## Overview
A LangChain RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) pipeline that answers questions
about the Skill Set Go EduTech AI/ML track by retrieving relevant passages from a
small knowledge base, instead of relying on the LLM's raw training data.

## Pipeline
1. Load `.txt` documents from `documents/`
2. Split into ~400-character chunks with 50-character overlap
3. Embed chunks locally with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` — no API key needed
4. Store vectors in a local **FAISS** index (`faiss_index/`)
5. Retrieve the top 3 most relevant chunks for a question
6. Generate a grounded answer with Groq (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`), citing which chunks it used

## Files
- `rag_pipeline.py` — the full pipeline, runnable end to end
- `documents/company_faq.txt` — the sample knowledge base
- `faiss_index/` — the saved vector index (`index.faiss`, `index.pkl`), generated automatically the first time the pipeline runs
- `architecture_notes.md` — detailed design notes and possible extensions

## Requirements
Needs a free Groq API key and internet access.

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
# add GROQ_API_KEY to your .env file
python3 rag_pipeline.py
```

## Sample result
Verified working — correctly answers questions like "What is the AI/ML track?"
and "What does the capstone need to include?", citing `company_faq.txt` as the source.

## Deliverable
Working RAG prototype + architecture notes, as required by the Skill Set Go
EduTech AI/ML track, Week 4, Task 4.1.
